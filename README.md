yooo whats up its drake i listened to your beats and they fire bro on god.
Come to my studio and we can make some fire beats together.
I'll fly you to LA free of charge man.
Oh and 12-17 thats my type.

oh and the difference between this and the old one is now i added 
reserve balls  and increased probability mode faster spins does nothing btw
it just summons an invisible green ball
also you have to wait for the effects that show up
to dissapear for the probability changes to take effect

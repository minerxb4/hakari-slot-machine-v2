yooo whats up its drake i listened to your beats and they fire bro on god
come to my studio and we can make some music together
ill fly you to la free of charge man
12-17 thats my type

oh and the difference between this and the old one is now i added 
reserve balls  and increased probability mode faster spins does nothing btw
it just summons an invisible green ball
also you have to wait for the effects that show up
to dissapear for the probability changes to take effect
